This project is an older one where I'm trying to learn how to create local server-side mechanics. 
For exameple I'm trying to create a series of chat servers that users can join into and use with a GUI.
Super basic but like I'm trying to learn how to do it based on my own reasoning and trying to understand how these server client relationships work on a deepr level.
